The purpose of the repository is to host a the data and eventual scripts that are used withing the CARISMA research center for network analysis.

For a more detailed description of the networks, and insights on the results obtained check:

Up to now, the _res/_ folder contains the dataframe of vertices and edges needed to reconstruct the graphs used for the Monza application, whose main results can be found in
